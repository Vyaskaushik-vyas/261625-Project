# 261625-Project
Project Repository
# Requirements
## Introduction
 To design a system which calculates the size of the Cable to be laid based on system parameters for a Substation

## Research
•	The conductor cross-section shall be chosen such that the conductor withstands prospective short circuit current for a specified duration of time.

•	Area of cross-section of the conductor shall be sized to carry estimated load current continuously such that the temperature rise of the conductor is within the acceptable limits for the installation conditions foreseen

•	Voltage drop within the cable is within the permissible limits so that the functionality of the connected load by the cable remains unaffected

## Cost and Features

• The main aim of the project is that the enginner will enter the necessary values of the current and voltages so he can get the Standard cable sizing in Indian standards(IS) required for laying 

• The advantage of this project the the quickness in which the program works and no need to perform heavy calculation which will be taken care by the program

• A lot of time and money can be saved in this project as the result leads to quick installation and accurate results.
 
## Defining MY System
   
• The system will be getting some essential paramenters from the user and it will compute the values and with which it will be able to choose or design a perticular crossection area of the conductor which can be put into use .
   
   
## SWOT ANALYSIS

• Strength     - It's capable of quick and accurate analysis
• Weakness     - It may not consider hetrogeneous materials of cable under consideration
• Oppertunities- The program can be made to accomodate all the derating factors affecting the cable sizing
• Threats      - Usage of hetrogeneous material and the use of the program may end up in wrong results


# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

• Substation Desing and installtion engineers will be able to use this program effectively to find the cable sizing

## What:

• The solution mainly shows the standard sizing of the cables to be laid in a substation with site parameters 


## When:

• This program is effective for laying cables in a substation of homogeneous material 

## Where:

• The solution is for proper standard sizing cables for transfer of electricity from producer to consumer. 

## How:

• It calculates the area of crossection of the cables to be laid with the help of site parameters and as well as the standard Indian Parameters
